# Web Technologies

## Situation

When students have to implement a Web - Application then we teachers are immediatly confronted by the student's choice of a Web - Framework that they want to use.
Most often they want to use React, Vue or Angular. 

The answer that I usually give is:
***As soon as you can explain to me what your Web-Browser can do, you are free to choose your Framework***.

Students that want to use a framework get the OK as soon as they are able to explain to me how the [pure](./code/readme.md) project works.

The pure project is browser native without any framework. 

My experience shows that it takes them a lot of attempts to succeed. 

At the end, when they are able to understand Typescript and the great features that their browser offers them, they most often do not use any framework at all because they found out that the Browser is a platform that gives them all they need to write great apps that can be supported for decades.
